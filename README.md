# Programming for Kids 
*Learn Python & Game Development Through Fun!*

## About "The Cyclist: An Unforeseen Journey"

Welcome to an exciting 7-day coding adventure where kids will learn Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by building a complete platformer game! By the end of this tutorial, students will have created "The Cyclist: An Unforeseen Journey" - a fun game where players navigate obstacles, collect rewards, and experience an epic cycling adventure.

## What You'll Learn

- **Python Basics**: Variables, constants, and basic syntax
- **Game Development**: Using Pygame library for graphics and interaction
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, and game entities
- **Game Logic**: Event handling, collision detection, and game loops
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps

## Course Structure

### Day 1: Intro to Pygame
- Basic Pygame setup and game window creation
- Understanding quit event handling
- Working with foreground and background layers
- Your first interactive game window!

### Day 2: Graphics and Scaling
- Changing screen resolution and display settings
- Adding background images and properly scaling to fit the screen
- Introducing the player character and player rectangles
- Positioning players using X and Y coordinates

### Day 3: Player Movement and Physics
- Defining key bindings and keyboard input handling
- Displaying different artwork when the player is jumping
- Introducing gravity mechanics to create realistic movement
- **Conclusion**: Detect key presses, check for spacebar, and move player upward

### Day 4: Enemies and Object-Oriented Programming
- Adding static enemy objects to the game
- Creating enemies with movement along the negative X-axis
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creating a Player class to manage player behavior

### Day 5: Advanced Movement and Collision
- Adding upward-only movement to the player sprite
- Implementing enemy objects using OOP principles
- Detecting and handling enemy collision events
- Removing enemy objects when they go out of bounds

### Day 6: Multiple Enemies and Rewards
- Creating multiple enemy types with different behaviors
- Regenerating enemies after collision events
- Adding randomness to enemy spawn positions
- Respawning enemies when they exit the screen
- Introducing reward/collectible objects

### Day 7: Game Polish and Final Features
- Adding score tracking and health display systems
- Implementing moving background for dynamic gameplay
- Creating a game over screen with restart functionality
- Adding a start game screen and increasing difficulty by reducing jump height

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer skills
- Python 3.7+ installed on your computer
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code or IDLE)
- Enthusiasm to learn and create!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-for-kids.git
   cd pygame-for-kids
   ```

2. **Install Pygame:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Start with Day 1:**
   ```bash
   # Open the day1.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
   # Or run the Python code directly
   python day1.py
   ```

## For Educators

This tutorial is designed to be:
- **Age-appropriate**: Suitable for ages 10+
- **Self-paced**: Students can work at their own speed
- **Hands-on**: Every concept is immediately applied
- **Progressive**: Each day builds on previous knowledge
- **Engaging**: Learning through game creation keeps students motivated

### Teaching Tips:
- Encourage experimentation with code
- Use the game as a canvas for creativity
- Relate programming concepts to real-world examples
- Celebrate small wins and progress
- Foster collaboration and code sharing

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Pygame not installing?** Make sure Python and pip are properly installed
- **Images not loading?** Check file paths and ensure images are in the correct folder
- **Game running slowly?** Try reducing screen resolution or image sizes
- **Code not working?** Compare with the provided solutions in each day's folder
