# Programming for Kids 
*Learn Python & Game Development Through Fun!*

## About "The Cyclist: An Unforeseen Journey"

Welcome to an exciting 7-day coding adventure where kids will learn Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by building a complete platformer game! By the end of this tutorial, students will have created "The Cyclist: An Unforeseen Journey" - a fun game where players navigate obstacles, collect rewards, and experience an epic cycling adventure.

## About Spiralogics & CSR Initiative

This program is part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by Spiralogics International Pvt. Ltd., a global software development company.

Every year, Spiralogics dedicates time and resources to Programming for Kids, with the mission of inspiring young learners to explore the world of technology and coding.

In 2025, the program took the form of teaching kids Python programming and game development with Pygame, allowing them to learn coding concepts through the excitement of creating their very own video game.

We believe that empowering the next generation with programming knowledge not only fosters creativity but also builds problem-solving skills that will serve them in all walks of life.

## What You'll Learn

- **Python Basics**: Variables, constants, and basic syntax
- **Game Development**: Using Pygame library for graphics and interaction
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, and game entities
- **Game Logic**: Event handling, collision detection, and game loops
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps

## Course Structure

### Day 1: Intro to Pygame
- Basic Pygame setup and game window creation
- Understanding quit event handling
- Working with foreground and background layers
- Your first interactive game window!

### Day 2: Graphics and Scaling
- Changing screen resolution and display settings
- Adding background images and properly scaling to fit the screen
- Introducing the player character and player rectangles
- Positioning players using X and Y coordinates

### Day 3: Player Movement and Physics
- Defining key bindings and keyboard input handling
- Displaying different artwork when the player is jumping
- Introducing gravity mechanics to create realistic movement
- **Conclusion**: Detect key presses, check for spacebar, and move player upward

### Day 4: Enemies and Object-Oriented Programming
- Adding static enemy objects to the game
- Creating enemies with movement along the negative X-axis
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creating a Player class to manage player behavior

### Day 5: Advanced Movement and Collision
- Adding upward-only movement to the player sprite
- Implementing enemy objects using OOP principles
- Detecting and handling enemy collision events
- Removing enemy objects when they go out of bounds

### Day 6: Multiple Enemies and Rewards
- Creating multiple enemy types with different behaviors
- Regenerating enemies after collision events
- Adding randomness to enemy spawn positions
- Respawning enemies when they exit the screen
- Introducing reward/collectible objects

### Day 7: Game Polish and Final Features
- Adding score tracking and health display systems
- Implementing moving background for dynamic gameplay
- Creating a game over screen with restart functionality
- Adding a start game screen and increasing difficulty by reducing jump height

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer skills
- Python 3.7+ installed on your computer
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code or IDLE)
